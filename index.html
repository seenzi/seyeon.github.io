                    They are people who can truly sympathize with my happy and difficult moments.
                    I am always grateful to my aunt and the rest of my family beyond my father, mother, and younger brother.
                    The second is my friends. They are precious people who make me smile without worrying when I'm with them all the time.</p>

                    I think my consideration that I gave will come back to me someday. 
                    I think helping others is like caring for me.</p>

                <h4 class="hobby_name">Scuba Diving</h4>
                <p class="hobby_comment">My favorite hobby is scuba diving. 
                    I started it when I was in middle school because my parents recommended me to explore the deep sea world.
                    My scuba buddy is my younger brother, taking care of each other and diving safely.
                    My favorite sea creature is the sea snail. It is good to be able to focus entirely on the sea without outside noise when you go into the sea. 
                    It is a valuable experience to be able to explore the sea from a wide earth.</p>

                <h4 class="hobby_name">Musical & Movie</h4>
                <p class="hobby_comment">I like to watch music movies. Instead of expressing emotions with lines, 
                    I like music movies because of the part where the main characters express emotions with songs. 
                    When you listen to the OST album of the movie, you can feel the emotions of the main characters directly as the story of the movie is drawn in your head, 
                    and you can enjoy the emotions at the time when you watched the movie. My favorite music movie is La La Land. 
                    It is a movie that shows the color of the movie and the expression of emotions through the main characters' music. 
                    In addition, there are Sing Street, Mamma Mia, and Begin Again.</p>

                <p class="hobby_comment">I liked to go to the baseball stadium since I was young. 
                    My favorite team is Doosan Bears. It's very fun to go and cheer in a uniform. 
                    Also, I am so happy if the team wins the game I went to the stadium and cheered for. 
                    Shouting at the baseball stadium also makes stress go away. 
                    Also, the chicken eaten at the baseball stadium is more delicious than anything else.
                    I was really happy when my favorite team won the season after a long time.</p>

                <p class="hobby_comment">Going to see an exhibition is one of my hobbies. 
                    As you look at the works of the exhibition, complex thoughts disappear. 
                    There are many hands-on exhibitions these days, so you don't have to approach them with difficulty. 
                    It is good to go with your friends and take many pictures, 
                    and it is good to go alone and read the explanation of the work slowly. 
                    go to various exhibitionsWhen you look at it, you also have an artistic perspective.</p>

                <h4 class="hobby_name">Drawing</h4>
                <p class="hobby_comment">Painting is one of my small hobbies. I am not good at drawing, but I put meaning on drawing. 
                    When you draw an object or a person, you have affection for the object without realizing it. 
                    Also, focusing on the act of painting clears my mind. 
                    The drawing process is difficult, but I continue to draw because of the proudness of seeing the work completed.</p>
